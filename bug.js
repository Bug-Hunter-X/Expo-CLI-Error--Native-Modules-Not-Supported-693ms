This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that uses a package that has native dependencies that are not compatible with the Expo managed workflow.  The error message might not be very specific and might just say something like "Error: Native modules are not supported in this environment" or something similar. This typically happens when you try to run `expo start` or `expo build` and a package you've installed requires native code (e.g., using React Native's `react-native-camera` directly).
